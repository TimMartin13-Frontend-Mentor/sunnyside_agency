## My process

I started with the navbar and the hero image, then worked my way down the page section by section. Having worked with the mobile first workflow for awhile, I tried to do the desktop version to this challenge first this time. I think that may have made it a bit harder but it seems to have turned out fine in the end.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- HTML

### What I learned

I learned that a mobile first workflow is usually the easiest way to do things. As I do more of these projects, I learn a little more about SCSS syntax and how to arrage the various fonts, colors, etc... I also added a little more animation to the hamburger menu to add a little flare to the project.

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn more about SCSS and the best practices for using it. I also want to start doing more JavaScript so that I can start using my programming background.
